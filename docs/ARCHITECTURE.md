# Architecture (Conceptual)

```
[Initial Access] -> [Recon/Discovery] -> [Prioritization/Targeting] -> [Execution/Impact]
                        |                         |
                        v                         v
                 [Data Selection]           [Extortion/Nego Bot]
```

## Modules (Hypothetical)
- Reconnaissance: Inventory assets, classify by criticality.
- Prioritization: Rank targets by business risk and blast radius.
- Execution: Living-off-the-land tools to minimize binaries.
- Negotiation: Guardrailed AI assistant (conceptual) for comms.

## Defensive Choke Points
- Email/Web gateways, EDR behavior rules, identity MFA/JIT, network segmentation, immutable backups.
