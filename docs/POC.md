# Proof of Concept (PoC) Summary

## Objective
- Document hypothetical AI-augmented ransomware workflows to inform defensive planning.
- Identify detection and control points across reconnaissance, execution, and extortion.

## Scope
- In scope: narrative analysis, diagrams, defensive considerations, references.
- Out of scope: any functional malware, exploits, encryption code, or deployment artifacts.

## Hypotheses & Success Criteria
- H1: Behavioral analytics outperform signature-based detection for AI-assisted campaigns.
- H2: Tiered backups and least-privilege materially reduce business impact.
- Success criteria: clear mapping of potential behaviors to controls and procedures.

## Approach
- Literature review and defender-centric modeling.
- Map hypothetical behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and detection ideas.

## Implementation Notes
- This repository is documentation-only. No code intended for execution is included or accepted.

## Results (Narrative)
- Key risk areas include rapid prioritization of sensitive data and automation cadence.
- Defensive leverage points include identity hygiene, segmentation, and curated detections.

## Decision
- Go-forward: use this as a reference for tabletop exercises and control validation.

## Appendix
- See `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for deeper details.
